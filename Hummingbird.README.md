HUMMINGBIRD
===========

Site tracking and analytics storage


Description
---------------

Hummingbird serves a 1x1 tracking pixel to users.  In the browser's GET request it
sends back tracking data generated by javascript.


Requirements
-------------------

 * node.js v0.8.0

Installation
--------------

    git clone git://github.com/mnutt/hummingbird.git
    cd hummingbird

    # Use npm to install the dependencies
    npm install

    # To use the map, download MaxMind's GeoIP database and extract to the root directory:
    wget http://geolite.maxmind.com/download/geoip/database/GeoLiteCity.dat.gz
    gunzip GeoLiteCity.dat.gz


Running Hummingbird
------------------------------

To start the analytics server, run the following:

    node server.js

By default a dashboard will be run on port 8080.  You can disable it for production use in
config/config.js.  The dashboard is just html served out of public/; you can serve it using
any webserver.


Deployment
----------

Make sure to properly secure the dashboard if you don't want outside people to see it. This
typically means putting the dashboard behind nginx or apache using basic auth. The dashboard's
'listen' function takes a second argument that is the interface to bind; typically you
would choose "127.0.0.1" to only allow access from localhost, or "0.0.0.0" to listen on all
interfaces.  You should then run the tracking pixel on a different port so that it is accessible
to the outside world.


Architecture Overview
---------------------

Hummingbird is organized into two parts: a node.js-based tracking server that records user
activity via a tracking pixel, and a collection of javascript-based widgets that display that
activity.  The server broadcasts all activity to the clients using Websockets if possible, and
falls back to Flash sockets or long polling if necessary.

The Hummingbird.WebSocket object receives websocket events from the server in the form of JSON
objects.  Individual widgets subscribe to a metric and register handler functions to be called 
whenever that metric is present.


Logging Customization
---------------------

Metrics are stored in lib/metrics and auto-loaded. Each metric contains a handler function that is
called every time a new user event occurs.  Metrics store data in the `data` object property which
gets emitted to clients in intervals specified by the metric. A basic example can be found in
lib/metrics/total_views.js. An example of how a metric can filter based on query params is in
lib/metric/cart_adds.js.


Display Customization
---------------------

Hummingbird comes with some stock widgets (Counter, Logger, Graph) that demonstrate how to hook into
the data provided by the node.js server.  For the minimum amount required to create a widget, see
public/js/widgets/logger.js.  A widget is an object whose prototype extends Hummingbird.Base and
implements onMessage.


Specs
--------

    sudo gem install jspec
    jspec run --node


Tips
-----

 * To run the UI locally but stream data from your production server, use the url http://localhost:8080/?ws_server=your-host.com&ws_port=12345
